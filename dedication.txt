I am deeply grateful to my supervisor, Prof. RNDr. Roman Bart√°k, Ph.D., for proposing such an interesting thesis topic that perfectly suited my interests, and for his invaluable guidance and support.

I would also like to thank all the teachers who have taught me throughout my life, especially those at MFF UK.

Last but not least, I want to express my sincere gratitude to my parents and close friends for their unconditional support.
