We will also omit the subscript m in the notation
, i.e.,
e.g.
Hence, we abuse the notation to let c →∗ tnˆ denote that the compound task c in some task network is

Particularly

M and t1, t2 (or t) are (is) nullable
By the induction hypothesis

In this paper, we shall present such a transformation and show how
the two models differ in regards to empty methods.

A world state is modelled
as a set of atomic propositions that are true in that state and
every other proposition is false (closed world assumption)

There might be multiple ways
to decompose a task, each of these is described through a
decomposition method

Let us be given a plan........mejme plan

In order to easier refer to states in each model we
will re-index the states in the

let us assume

For a regular action ai, it 
holds
