Each planning domain is defined as a list of methods. Each method is placed on a separate line and consists of three parts: Head compound task, subtasks, constraints. HEAD-->(subtask1,subtask2,...);[constr1,constr2,...]. No white spaces are allowed. To allow multiple identical subtasks, each subtask is indexed (SUBTASK#index). Compound tasks start with a capital letter while primitive tasks start with lower letter. Multiple subtasks with identical name and index are omited. Names of tasks must start with a letter and may continue with both letters and digits.
